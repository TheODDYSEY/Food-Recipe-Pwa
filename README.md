- **Installable:** Add the app to your device's home screen for quick access, just like a native app.
- **App-like Experience:** Navigate through the app with smooth animations and user-friendly design.
- **Caching Strategies:** Leverages service workers and Workbox to implement caching strategies for popular and recently viewed recipes.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this project, you need:

- Basic knowledge of service workers, Cache API, and Vue3.
- Vue CLI installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b starter https://github.com/Priyesco/food-recipe-pwa.git
   cd food-recipe-pwa
   npm install
   ```

   (Continue with the setup steps mentioned in the original tutorial.)

## Introduction to PWA

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that utilizes modern web technologies to provide a user experience similar to native apps. PWAs can work on various platforms, adapt to different screen sizes, and offer offline functionality through service workers.

## Key Concepts of PWA

Progressive Web Apps are built around several key concepts to enhance user experience:

- **Offline Availability:** PWAs can work offline or in low-network conditions by caching essential resources using service workers.
- **Responsive Design:** PWAs adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations, offering a consistent experience on various devices.
- **Installable:** Users can install PWAs on their device's home screen or app menu, providing quick access without going through an app store.
- **App-like Feel:** PWAs aim to provide a seamless and app-like user experience with smooth animations and navigation patterns.

## Pros and Cons of PWA

**Pros:**
- Works on various devices, reducing the need for separate development.
- Can be installed directly from the browser without app store dependencies.
- Immediate updates without manual downloads.
- Cost-effective compared to developing separate native apps.
- Push notifications for re-engaging users.

**Cons:**
- Limited iOS support for some PWA functionalities.
- Browser-imposed storage limitations.
- Initial page load may be slow due to resource caching.
- Managing offline content can be complex.

## Build a Food Recipe PWA with Vue3

### Cloning the Starter Vue App

```bash
git clone -b starter https://github.com/Priyesco/food-recipe-pwa.git
cd food-recipe-pwa
npm install
```

(Continue with the rest of the instructions from the tutorial.)

## Testing the PWA Locally

To test the PWA locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the HTTP server globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

2. Build the app and serve it:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   serve -s dist -l 4000
   ```

   Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser to access the app.

3. Simulate offline behavior:

   - Check the "offline" checkbox.
   - Ensure network requests are not blocked (Throttling dropdown -> No throttling).

   (Continue with testing as per the tutorial.)

## Customizing the PWA

The PWA can be customized to suit your preferences. Modify the `vue.config.js` file to configure options such as caching strategies, service worker behavior, and more.

```javascript
// vue.config.js

const { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service');

module.exports = defineConfig({
  transpileDependencies: true,
  pwa: {
    workboxOptions: {
      runtimeCaching: [
        // Specify your caching strategies here
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

## Prompt Users to Install the PWA

You can prompt users to install the PWA using the `beforeinstallprompt` event. Customize the installation experience within your Vue components.

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="pwaInstall">Install</button>
</template>

<script setup>
import { onBeforeMount } from 'vue';

let pwaInstallEvent;

onBeforeMount(() => {
  window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    pwaInstallEvent = e;
  });
});

const pwaInstall = async () => {
  pwaInstallEvent.prompt();
  const { outcome } = await pwaInstallEvent.userChoice;
  if (outcome === 'accepted') {
    // Take extra actions if the user opts for installation.
  } else {
    // Take extra actions if the user cancels.
  }
};
</script>
```
